I am a PhD candidate at the Global Economics and Management Department, University of Groningen.  My research interest relates to how organisations learn from performance feedback, pursue multiple goals, search for solutions in complex landscapes, and change over time.  I enjoy exploring these topics related to the behavioural theory of the firm from an international business point of view. 

You can find my pre-doctoral research [here](https://jbolanoshurtado.github.io/publications/ "To current research"), and my cv with additional details [here](https://jbolanoshurtado.github.io/cv/ "To my CV").

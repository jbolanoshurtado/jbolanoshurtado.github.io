I am a Research Master student at the Graduate School of Economics and Business, University of Groningen. My research interests converge on expanding the behavioural theory of the firm employing an international business lens. Currently, I am exploring the challenges that companies face for learning from performance feedback throughout their internationalisation process.

In pursuing research about organisations, I have used both quantitative and qualitative methods as well as theoretical/computational organisational models.

You can check my research [here](https://jbolanoshurtado.github.io/publications/ "To current research"), and my cv [here](https://jbolanoshurtado.github.io/cv/ "To my CV").

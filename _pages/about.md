I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Global Economics and Management, University of Groningen.

My interest is in the behavioural theory of the firm and topics related to it. These include learning from performance feedback, the pursuit of multiple goals, searching for solutions in difficult landscapes, and organisational change.  I enjoy exploring these topics from an International Business point of view.

You can find my previous research [here](https://jbolanoshurtado.github.io/publications/ "To current research"), and my cv with additional details [here](https://jbolanoshurtado.github.io/cv/ "To my CV").

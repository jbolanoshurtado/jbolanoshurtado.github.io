I am a Research Master student at the Graduate School of Economics and Business, University of Groningen. My research interests converge on expanding the behavioural theory of the firm employing an international business lens. Currently, I am exploring the sources of ambiguity that hamper learning from performance feedback for internationalising firms.


In the pursuit of my research interests, I have used both quantitative and qualitative methods as well as theoretical/computational organisational models. In previous years, I have worked on studies about export promotion programmes, firm export capabilities, and export performance.

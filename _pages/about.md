I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Global Economics and Management, University University of Groningen. My research interest relates to the behavioural theory of the firm: learning from performance feedback, multiple goals pursuit, landscape search processes, and organisational change.  I enjoy exploring these topics from an International Business point of view.

You can find my previous research [here](https://jbolanoshurtado.github.io/publications/ "To current research"), and cv with additional details [here](https://jbolanoshurtado.github.io/cv/ "To my CV").
